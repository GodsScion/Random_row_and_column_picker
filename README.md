# Random row and column picker


Having trouble picking a file among a grid of multiple files where the files could be images, videos, music etc. Look no more and run this python file.

Requirement: Python 3.10 or greater must be installed and it's path added in environment variables. An empty file named "A1Watched.txt" must be created in the same location as the python file. If you're using Windows and if the location of A1Watched.txt file is in your Windows Defender's Controlled Folder Access, don't forget to let python program access it.

Recommended to run using Python.
